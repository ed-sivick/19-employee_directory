## User_Story:
As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.
____
## Installation
(1) Go to the `src` folder in VS Code, right-click, select **Open in Integrated Terminal** and type: **npm i** (install) to install all required dependencies for the app, creating the **node modules** folder and **package-lock.json** file   
(2) Type **npm start** to invoke the app     
(3) The App will automatically open a webpage on **localhost:3000** displaying the **Avengers Employee Directory**   
_____
## Usage
This app shows how an employee or manager could benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by tenure, and specific personal strengths or abilities.  A group of random Avengers (a fictional team of superheroes created by Marvel comics) was selected to build this app.  The employee or manager has the ability to:   
- Sort the Avengers directory per the length of time since each character was created by Marvel comics (from longest tenure to shortest tenure, or vice versa)
- Filter the Avengers directory per their individual Power Unit (Energy, Fly, Senses, Size, Strength, or Weapons)   
- The Directory can be re-set to the original display by sorting per **Default**, and Filter per **All**, and re-freshing the page
